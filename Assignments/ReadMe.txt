This is the directory structure:
Assignments contains Assignment1-> Problem1 -> disc,ring,star
                                -> Problem2 -> chessBoard,triangle
                                -> Problem3 -> disc,chessboard,star


The Shader Class file contains the shader class used in some of the problems.


PLEASE NOTE:
THE PATH TO AN IMAGE OR SHADER FILE MUST BE CHANGED SINCE THE PATH IN THE CODE IS MY LOCAL PATH.
